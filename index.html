      <p>Hello, my name is Justin Abruzzese and this website is a living portolio of my work in web development. Currently it is under production and awaiting some more improvements in readability and responsiveness. Will rebuild this site as my knowledge grows. As for myself, I am new to the world of coding and currently taking a bootcamp through UCF targeting front and back end development with focus on the MERN stack.</p>
